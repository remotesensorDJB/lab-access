### VPN Connection

If this is your first time connecting to UofL’s VPN on your computer, you must visit https://vpn.louisville.edu, login using your ULINK credentials, and then download and install the VPN client for your operating system.

### Remote Desktop Connection

+++
We will use a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X1Io7mqJMSW5o2-YFQ2C5RphsrJz-6mx75jz_6lCjWE/edit?usp=sharing) to track who is using a PC remotely at any time. Please make sure you sign in and sign out of this spreadsheet when you use a PC remotely. 
+++
Select an available PC from the sign in log. Fill out the form next to the PC you select, and copy the Computer Name from the spreadsheet.

+++
Mac users: please download the [Remote Desktop app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12) from the App Store, and then follow the directions in [this video](https://youtu.be/HpMRE2LRjlw) to set up the connection.
+++
Windows users: Search for "remote" in the Windows Search bar. Click on "Remote Desktop Connection" in the results.

You should now be greeted with a Windows desktop for your assigned lab machine. You can tell that this is a remote connection because of the blue menu bar at the top of the screen.

+++
 You may now use the remote PC for your classwork. Here are a few tips to ensure a good experience.

- USB devices plugged into your physical machine will not register on the remote PC. 
- The easiest way to move data back & forth is through cloud storage like Cardbox or Google Drive.
+++
- Your instructor may post data to Blackboard. Open a web browser **on the remote PC** and download the data
    - Your remote PC is on UofL’s gigabit network, so downloads should be very speedy. 
- You may create a folder on the C:\ drive in which to store your work. 
    - Name it as follows: userID-CourseNumber. For instance, Jon Snow (the [physician](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=781630562fea4ad88e94bd22e161ba06&webmap=f4d1c17a8f1544c8903060a1e329103a), not the [true heir to the Iron Throne](https://www.insider.com/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-rightful-heir-iron-throne-targaryen-succession-2017-8)), taking GEOG 500, would be *j0snow01-GEOG500*.

### Getting "Bumped"
+++
If you receive this screen, it means someone is already connected to the PC you chose. If you select yes, that user has 30 seconds to deny your log in.

![Disconnect](images/disconnect.PNG)
+++
You will see this screen while you wait for the user to respond...

![Respond](images/respond.PNG)
+++
If you see this screen, the user has denied your log in. Please go back to the spreadsheet and choose another PC. 

![Denied](images/denied.PNG)
+++
Alternately, if you are logged in and receive this message, someone else is trying to "bump" you. You have 30 seconds to respond "cancel" to deny their log in. 

![Allow](images/allow.PNG)
+++
Please note that being "bumped" does not shut down your programs and files. Your session will be preserved. 

###### If we all use the Google Spreadsheet, we should not encounter too many issues.

### THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!!

The **MOST IMPORTANT THING** that you MUST remember each time you use a remote PC, is to LOG OFF the machine when you are finished. 


Click the Windows icon, then click the user icon and choose Sign out.

That’s it...that’s the deal. Good luck and please contact Donald J Biddle via MS Teams or email at [djbidd01@louisville.edu](mailto:djbidd01@louisville.edu).
